## Checkpoint #26 - Basic Rails App, Checkpoint Assignment: 'new_options' Rails
## app.

Using the commnd 'rails new app_name qualifiers', I ran the following command
to create a new Rails application.

```
rails new new_options -T -B
```

The '-T' switch prevents the inclusion of Rails Unit files for unit testing.
The '-B' switch prevents running a bundle install.
